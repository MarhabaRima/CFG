//Objects are used to store collections of data and 
// more complex entities.

//Example:
const personObject = {
    //key: value
    name: 'Rima',
    age: 29,
    city: 'London',
    travelDestination: 'South Korea'
}
//we have one variable called personObject
//it has 4 key value pairs
//it is better than storing the data in separate variables
//accessing the values of the object
console.log(personObject.name); //output: Rima
