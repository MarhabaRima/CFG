//Undefined is a type in JavaScript that represents an uninitialized variable. It is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared or to formal parameters for which there are no actual arguments. It is also returned by functions that have no return value.
// Example

let hello = 'Hello'

let goodbye

let greeting = null

//console.log(hello) // Hello
//console.log(goodbye) // undefined - variable declared but not initialized
//console.log(greeting) // null
console.log(helo) // ReferenceError: helo is not defined - does not exist in the first place
