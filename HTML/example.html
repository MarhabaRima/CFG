<!--HTML is a markup language that is used to create web pages. 
It is the most basic building block of the web. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
HTML elements are represented by tags. HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. 
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--This declaration is required for HTML5 documents. -->
<!--It is used to tell the browser what version of HTML the page is written in. -->
<html lang = "en"> <!--The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page. -->
<head> <!--The <head> element contains meta information about the document, such as its title, and links to its stylesheets and scripts. -->
<meta charset = "UTF-8"> <!--The <meta> element is used to specify the character encoding for the HTML document. -->
<title>Page Title</title> <!--The <title> element is used to specify the title of the HTML document. -->
</head> <!--The <head> element contains meta information about the document, such as its title, and links to its stylesheets and scripts. -->
<body> <!--The <body> element contains the content of the HTML document. -->
<h1> <!--This is a Heading</h1> //The <h1> element is used to define a heading. -->
<p> <!--This is a paragraph.</p> //The <p> element is used to define a paragraph. -->

<!-- Example: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
