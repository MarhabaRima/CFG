# CFG Repository  

## About  
This repository contains all my practice work during CFG (Code First Girls) classes. It includes projects and exercises in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and API development. Each folder is structured to help organize my learning journey, covering different programming concepts and testing techniques.

## Fun Fact About Learning to Code  
Did you know that the first-ever computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, back in the 1840s? She wrote the first algorithm intended for Charles Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine, even before computers existed! So if you're struggling with coding, just rememberâ€”you're continuing a long history of problem-solving and innovation! ðŸš€  

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
